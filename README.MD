<!-- ### Project idea 
> This is a site where users will be able to find party games of different categories, so as enter (share) their own games they like. Users also will be able to rate games and leave a comment.  

### MVP User stories

- As a user, I would like to be able to create an account to access the site.
- As a user, once account is create, I would like to log in by typing User Name and User Password.
- As a user, on the first I would like to have access to all the games.
- As a user, I would like to be able to sort the games by categories (kids, adults etc.)
- As a user, I would like to leave a comment and rate games that I like/disliked.
- As a user, I would like to be able to log out.

### Stretch Goals
- As a user, I would like to be able to mark favorite games.
- As a user, I would like to create a list of favorite games.
- As a user, I would like to be able to sort games by rating and date uploaded.
